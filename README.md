# :hover Pseudo-class Not Working

This repository demonstrates a common issue where the `:hover` pseudo-class in CSS unexpectedly fails to apply to a specific element.  The example includes a basic HTML structure and corresponding CSS, showcasing the problem and its solution.

## Problem
The `:hover` pseudo-class is not working on the second `<p>` element in this example, despite being applied identically to the first `<p>` element.  Inspecting the element using the browser's developer tools reveals no apparent conflicts.  This often points to a problem with event listeners, specificity, or potentially other underlying issues with the DOM.

## Solution
The problem was solved by ensuring no other CSS rules or JavaScript event listeners were interfering with the element's hover behavior. In this case, it was a `z-index` conflict.
